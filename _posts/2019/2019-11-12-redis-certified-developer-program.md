# Certification Criteria
## 1. General Computer Science, Database, and Redis Knowledge

Section | Behaviour and Knowledge | Practice and Study
---|---|---
1.1 | Understand the general concept of computational complexity, including time-complexity and space-complexity | Performance and Big-O Notation in RU101: Introduction to Redis Data Structures; [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity)
1.2 | Understand the relative differences between O(1) (constant-time), O(log(n)) (logarithmic), and O(n) (linear-time) complexity | [https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/)
1.3 | Understand the definition of an atomic operation | [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomicity_(database_systems)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomicity_(database_systems)); [https://redis.io/topics/transactions](https://redis.io/topics/transactions)
1.4 | Understand the differences between an in-memory database and an on-disk database. Know that Redis is an in-memory database and that all read and write operations happen in RAM | [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-memory_database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-memory_database); [https://redis.io/topics/faq](https://redis.io/topics/faq)
1.5 | Understand, at a high level, the persistence options provided by Redis (disabled, RDB, AOF) | [https://redis.io/topics/faq](https://redis.io/topics/faq); [https://redis.io/topics/persistence](https://redis.io/topics/persistence); [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durability_(database_systems)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durability_(database_systems))
1.6 | Understand the differences between Open-Source Redis and Redis Enterprise | [https://redislabs.com/redis-enterprise/](https://redislabs.com/redis-enterprise/)
1.7 | Understand that Redis has a module API that allows for the development of compiled modules that extend the basic functionality of Redis (RediSearch / RedisBloom / RedisTimeSeries / RedisJSON) | &bull; [https://oss.redislabs.com/redisearch/](https://oss.redislabs.com/redisearch/)<br/>&bull; [https://oss.redislabs.com/redisbloom/](https://oss.redislabs.com/redisbloom/)<br/>&bull; [https://oss.redislabs.com/redistimeseries/](https://oss.redislabs.com/redistimeseries/)<br/>&bull; [https://oss.redislabs.com/redisjson/](https://oss.redislabs.com/redisjson/)<br/>

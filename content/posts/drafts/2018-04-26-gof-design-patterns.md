    One of the ways that I measure the quality of an object-oriented system is to judge whether or not its developers have paid careful attention to the common collaborations among its objects.

### Guide to Readers

* Read the catalog from start to finish
* Study one of the chapters - see how closely related patterns are distinguished
* Use a problem directed approach - read common problem (Section 1.6) - read patterns that address the problems
* Read simple patterns first: Abstract Factory; Adapter; Composite; Decorator; Factory Method; Observer; Strategy; Template Method 

## 1 Introduction

Each pattern has 4 parts:
1. Pattern name - allows design at a higher level of abstraction
2. Problem - when to apply the pattern, the problem and its context e.g. how to represent algorithms as objects
3. Solution - design elements, responsibities, collaborations - template - how a general arrangement of classes and objects solves the problem
4. Consequences - results and trade offs of applying the pattern

"Refactoring" is derived from the word "factoring" used in structured programming which means to decompose a program into its constituent parts as much as possible.
Refactoring is Editing. When writing a new feature, think of the initial code as similar to the first draft of a document. Refactoring takes you from the first draft to the final version. 

	I have made [this letter] longer than usual because I have not had time to make it shorter. Blaise Pascal, 1657.

	Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that a human can understand. Martin Fowler, Refactoring.

Over time software rots or decays:
* Duplication
* Excess Coupling
* Quick fixes
* Hacks
* Technical Debt - the sum of the 4 above

Refactoring ensures our system continues to operate like a well-oiled machine rather than degrading into a pile of digital rust that must soon be replaced. 

Refactoring is mainly about two things: eliminating duplication and simplifying the design.

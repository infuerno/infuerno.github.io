## How to

### Names

- If a person's surname is unknown add `//` at the end or `/?/`

### Dates

- Enter dates which are not to be interpreted in quotes e.g. `"3 weeks after his wife died"`
- Use the Date Entry Assistant Dialog to enter complex dates, ranges etc
  - `?` or `c` or `approx` with a simple date for approximate dates (appears as `c.`)
  - `~` or `est` with a simple date for estimated dates
  - `cal` with a simple date for calculated dates
  - `from`, `to`, `before`, `after` respectively
  - `q` before 1,2,3,4 for quarters e.g. `q1`

### Family and Relationship tasks

Relationships will either be parent-child or spouse

- Cite sources for a spouse relationship - record a marriage event and attach source information to that
- Cite sources for a parent-child relations - i.e. X of the son of Y or Y is the parent of X - create a birth event for X and switch to the Facts tab of the property box, select the birth even and open the Witnesses window - add Y as a witness with the role of father, mother or parent (this is specifically not included in narration, hence the reason to do it this way)

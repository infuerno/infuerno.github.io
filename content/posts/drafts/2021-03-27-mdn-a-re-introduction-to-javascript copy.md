## History

- December 2009 ES5
- June 2015 ES6

## Host environment required

> The JavaScript language has no concept of input or output. It is designed to run as a scripting language in a host environment, and it is up to the host environment to provide mechanisms for communicating with the outside world.

Common host environments for JavaScript include:

- the browser
- Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Photoshop
- SVG images
- Yahoo's Widget engine
- server-side environments e.g. Node.js
- NoSQL databases e.g. the open source Apache CouchDB
- embedded computers
- complete desktop environments e.g. GNOME

## Characteristics

- multi-paradigm, dynamic language

* supports object-oriented programming with object prototypes, instead of classes
* supports functional programming since functions are objects

## Built in types

- Number
- String
- Boolean
- Symbol (new in ES2015)
- Object
  - Function
  - Array
  - Date
  - RegExp
- null
- undefined

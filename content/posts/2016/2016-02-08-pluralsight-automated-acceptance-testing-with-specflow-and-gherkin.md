## Overview

* Acceptance tests are from a business point of view
* Written in a non technical format
* Pass or fail - no middle ground
* Helps definte what "done" means

### Features


### Scenarios



### Scenario Steps

Given: Set up initial state
When: Perform action
Then: End state

### Data Tables

* Useful for replacing multiple steps in the same scenario (e.g. multiple given steps). In this instance when the code is generated a paramter is generated which makes the datatable available to the test
* Useful for creating Scenario Outline to generate multiple Scenarios. Placeholders are use in the steps

Test taken: Lewisham, London in September 2018  
Result: PASSED!

## The Test

* 24 multiple choice questions in 45 minutes on "British traditions and customs"

## The Book

* The text from the [official book](https://www.tsoshop.co.uk/Life-in-the-UK/Life-in-the-United-Kingdom-A-Guide-for-New-Residents/?TrackID=002353) is available on lots of sites FREE online (see [resources](/resources/)) (though the actual book has some nice illustrative photos in places)
* All 24 multiple choice questions are FROM THE text in the OFFICIAL BOOK
* There are 5 chapters in total
* Chapters 1 and 2 are very short but chapters 3, 4, and 5 are all substantial
* There are lots of practice tests FREE online too (see [resources](r/esources/))
* A couple of these sites have tests **divided by chapter**, useful as you start to go through the material (see below)
* Note that most of the online tests are more difficult that the official practice test book / the actual test

## Study method

It is helpful to keep doing practice tests as you start reading the book. Use a site which breaks the practice questions down by chapter so you are only presented with questions based on information already read.

1. Read chapters 1 and 2 - take [a practice test made up only of the material of chapters 1 and 2](https://lifeintheuktestweb.co.uk/test-1-2/)
2. Read the first section of chapter 3 - take [a practice test of only the material of chapter 3](https://lifeintheuktestweb.co.uk/test-3-1/) - ignore any questions not yet covered
3. Use the [timelines](/timelines/) to review some of the date based facts in a different format. (The timelines were created from the material in the book whilst studying.)
4. Read the next section of chapter 3 - take another chapter 3 test, covering off all material covered in chapter 3 so far - ignore any questions not yet covered (hopefully less now)
5. Rinse and repeat for the rest of chapter 3 and then chapters 4 and 5
6. Having read the whole book, do whole tests online on all the material
7. Finally, find the [official test book](https://www.tsoshop.co.uk/Life-in-the-UK/Life-in-the-United-Kingdom-Official-Practice-Questions-and-Answers/?TRACKID=002353) (libraries have them) and take those tests - the questions on these tests will be more similar / the same as the real test (cf most online tests)
8. If you haven't done [the test on the official website](http://www.officiallifeintheuk.co.uk/test/), do this now too

<ul>
  <li>Read the catalog from start to finish</li>
  <li>Study one of the chapters - see how closely related patterns are distinguished</li>
  <li>Use a problem directed approach - read common problem (Section 1.6) - read patterns that address the problems</li>
  <li>Read simple patterns first: Abstract Factory; Adapter; Composite; Decorator; Factory Method; Observer; Strategy; Template Method</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="1-introduction">1 Introduction</h2>

<p>Each pattern has 4 parts:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Pattern name - allows design at a higher level of abstraction</li>
  <li>Problem - when to apply the pattern, the problem and its context e.g. how to represent algorithms as objects</li>
  <li>Solution - design elements, responsibities, collaborations - template - how a general arrangement of classes and objects solves the problem</li>
  <li>Consequences - results and trade offs of applying the pattern</li>
</ol>

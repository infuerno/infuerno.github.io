<h3 id="access-control-subjects-and-objects">Access Control Subjects and Objects</h3>

<p>Access Control <em>Subjects</em> are anything that will be accessing a resource on a network. This is generally a user, but can also be apps, web services, computers (e.g. laptops on a corporate network) and networks (which can be both subjects and objects) etc.</p>

<p>Access Control <em>Objects</em> are the resources accessed by those subjects. For example files, databases, apps (which need controlled access), web services, networks, facilities.</p>

<h3 id="identification-authentication-and-authorization">Identification, Authentication and Authorization</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>Identification</dt>
  <dd>saying who you are.</dd>
  <dt>Authentication</dt>
  <dd>identification with proof.</dd>

<h3 id="access-control-systems">Access Control Systems</h3>

<p>These systems tie these three things together. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Airports are a type of access control system to only allow the right people onto flights.</li>
  <li>Security clearance levels and the system which assigns levels</li>
  <li>Car licence plates, police officers to check</li>
  <li>Credit cards, signature checking if you need to sign</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="access-control-system-properties">Access Control System Properties</h3>

<p>Password complexity and changes required
Easily forged subjects arenâ€™t allowed - e.g. IP addresses (though much easier to forge now), currency
Object owners determine object permissions - often when you create a file, you will have full permissions to it
Secure by default - all object access is denied by default
User IDs cannot be transferred
Subject and object access can be audited - nowadays most system allow you to enable audit logging</p>

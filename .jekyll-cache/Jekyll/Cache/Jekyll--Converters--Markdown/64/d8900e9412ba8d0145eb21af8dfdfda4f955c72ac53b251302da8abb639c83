<h3 id="toolbar">Toolbar</h3>

<p>The toolbar can be toggled into a double panel using the arrows at the top. Tools are grouped into related items using a bolder horizonal line. 6.8.4.2.3.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Selections group</li>
  <li>Image editing and painting group</li>
  <li>Vector group - draw, select</li>
  <li>Generalised group of tools - zoom tool, hand tool</li>
  <li>Foreground and background tools</li>
</ul>

<p>Each tool has a keyboard shortcut which can be used to switch to it.</p>

<h3 id="windows-and-panels">Windows and panels</h3>

<p>Documents open up in the <em>document window</em>. This has a default background colour, but can be changed to black or any custom colour by right clicking on the surface.</p>

<p>Multiple document windows can be tabbed, free standing, or arranged using the Window &gt; Arrange menu.</p>

<p>Workspace layouts can be saved using the Window &gt; Workspace &gt; New Workspace… menu item.</p>

<h2 id="layers">Layers</h2>

<p>Layers are the most important aspect of Photoshop.</p>

<p>You can add, delete, group, ungroup, lock, unlock, name, rename, move adjust, show, hide, blend together, change opacity, add effects.</p>

<h3 id="layers-panel">Layers panel</h3>

<p>When a new layer is added it can be moved to the correct position in the document hierarchy by dragging it in the layers panel.</p>

<p>Layers can be grouped to keep them organised. This also allows them to be moved around together.</p>

<p>Different types of layers include: type, shape, adjustment (e.g. hue / saturation), image and transparent layers.</p>

<p>Layers panel options allows you to adjust how the information in the layers panel is displayed.</p>

<p>The first layer will always be called “Background” and has some restrictions: it will always be called Background, it is always locked, and it cannot be moved around the canvas. It can be changed into a normal layer by right clicking and choosing “Layer from Background…” (or just double clicking).</p>

<h3 id="blending-modes">Blending modes</h3>

<p>When a new layer is added the options at the top of the layers panel will reflect the options for this particular layer. The layer can be moved, transformed, have a filter applied or have a different blending mode.</p>

<p>The different blending modes are broken down into groups: normal, darken, lighten, contrast, inversion, cancellation, component. This can be scrolled through using ‘Shift +’ with the Move tool selected. Use blending modes in conjunction with different opacities to change the effect.</p>

<h3 id="layer-styles">Layer styles</h3>

<p>Layer styles are one or more layer effects and blending options applied to a layer. Familiar styles include drop shadows and gradients.</p>

<p>Double clicking on a layer reveals the Layer Style options window. Styles can be turned on and off and the defaults adjusted. A set of styles can be saved as a preset. Existing presets can be applied by clicking on the top ‘Styles’ label on the left hand side. Layer styles can be copied and pasted between layers using the context menu. A layer style can be separated out into different layers again using the context menu. This would allow the movement of e.g. a drop shadow independently of the shape.</p>

<h2 id="masks">Masks</h2>

<p>Masks are used to reveal or hide specific parts of an image, text, adjustment layer, smart object or any other type of layer to reveal the layer or transparency below.
When part of a layer is masked it is visually hidden and protected from any changes made to the rest of the layer. Masks can be used instead of an eraser and can then be disabled, edited or removed entirely.</p>

<p>Applying black or grey tones to a mask will hide or protect parts of an image, using white will reveal parts of an image.</p>

<p>Two common maskes are pixel masks and vector masks.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Pixel mask</dt>
  <dd>Resolution dependent bitmap images that are edited with the painting or selection tools.</dd>
  <dt>Vector mask</dt>
  <dd>Resolution independent and created with a pen or shape tool. They have sharp lines.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="setting-a-mask">Setting a mask</h3>

<p>The Quick Selection Tool (W) can be used to roughly select parts of an image. Adding a vector mask from the bottom of the layers panel then masks out any unselected areas. The backslash key can be used to toggle between a normal mask and a traditional rubylith mask.</p>

<h3 id="refining-a-mask">Refining a mask</h3>

<p>Adding a coloured layer behind may be useful to show up the edges properly. Mostly they will need some adjustment. The Refine Edge Option tool helps to adjust the edge - select the layer and mask - from the menu choose Select &gt; Refine Mask…</p>

<h3 id="perfecting-a-mask">Perfecting a mask</h3>

<p>For finer adjustments the brush tool can be used. There are several settings available in the options. General brush type, specific brush type, size ([ to decrease, ] to increase) and hardness (shift [ to decrease, shift ] to increase). Opacity and flow can also be adjusted.</p>

<p>Press the spacebar to momentarily bring up the hand tool.</p>

<p>Having masked away the background of an image, a different image can be shown behind instead..</p>

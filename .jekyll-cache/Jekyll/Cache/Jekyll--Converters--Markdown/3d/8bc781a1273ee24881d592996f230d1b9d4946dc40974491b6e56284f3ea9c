<p>‚ÄúRefactoring‚Äù is derived from the word ‚Äúfactoring‚Äù used in structured programming which means to decompose a program into its constituent parts as much as possible.
Refactoring is Editing. When writing a new feature, think of the initial code as similar to the first draft of a document. Refactoring takes you from the first draft to the final version.</p>

<p>Over time software rots or decays:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Duplication</li>
  <li>Excess Coupling</li>
  <li>Quick fixes</li>
  <li>Hacks</li>
  <li>Technical Debt - the sum of the 4 above</li>
</ul>

<p>Refactoring ensures our system continues to operate like a well-oiled machine rather than degrading into a pile of digital rust that must soon be replaced.</p>

<p>Refactoring is mainly about two things: eliminating duplication and simplifying the design.</p>

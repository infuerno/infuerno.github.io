<p>Good to structure classes with the class methods first, instance methods, most important first and then any private methods.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>class Panda
    # class methods
    def self.sleep?
    end
    # instance methods
    def eat(food)
    end
    # private methods
    private
    def your_eyes_only
    end
end
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Can only inherit from one other class, but can include modules using include.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>class Panda &lt; Animal
end

class Panda &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    include Animal
end
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Single quoted strings are faster than double quoted strings - the Ruby interpreter doesnâ€™t have to check the single quoted strings for any interpolation. Symbols are EVEN faster. Use where possible if something isnâ€™t going to change - often something in the domain of the application.</p>

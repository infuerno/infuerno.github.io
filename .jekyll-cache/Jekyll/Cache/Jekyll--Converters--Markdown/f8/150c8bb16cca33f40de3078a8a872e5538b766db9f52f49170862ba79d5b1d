<blockquote>
  <p>Everything is Design. It’s important to note that all software development involves considerable skill in design. In some circles, there is an attempt to distinguish between architects (or designers) and coders. The idea is that someone can be able to work with a language – coding – but not quite ready to do design work. The coders can be given a detailed “specification” from which they can write code.</p>
